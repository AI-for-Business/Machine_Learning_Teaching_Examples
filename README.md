# What is this repository?
This repository contains live coding examples for one selected descriptive and one predictive machine learning technique. On the descriptive side, the k-Means approach is presented as a clustering method including the dimensionality reduction approach with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and various optimisation iterations including the evaluation of the clustering quality by using the Silhouette index. As a predictive approach, the prepared data is processed with the goal of predicting the salary interval using the CART decision tree through the application of various validation methods (as a representative of classification methods). The coding examples are part of the course 'Machine Learning', which is offered to Bachelor students at the University of Hohenheim as an elective module.

# What can I use it for?
The code examples in the repository can be applied to various business use cases. Lecturers can use this repository to give students a first Python-based introduction to selected descriptive and predictive machine learning methods. This repository can therefore serve as a guide for teachers and students on how clustering and classification tasks (including iterative optimisation loops) can be applied to real-world business data. For this purpose, open source data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository was used to perform both techniques:

# What do I need in order to use it?
This program has been written in Python by using Jupyter Notebook. Please download Jupyter Notebook (e.g. via the Anaconda distribution) together with the corresponding datasets to use the code units. Integrated libaries and packages need to be installed.
